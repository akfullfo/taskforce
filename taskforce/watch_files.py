class watch(object):
	"""
	Sets up an instance that can be included in a select/poll set.  The
	descriptor will become readable whenever registered files change.

	Because the class has a fileno() method, the class instance can generally
	be used directly with select/poll.

	The intent of this interface is to insulate the caller from the
	system-dependent implementations of Unix file system event notification
	(kevent on *BSD/MacOS, inotify on Linux).  The interface also supports
	a polling mode which is much less efficient, but probably better than
	nothing.

	At the moment, inotify is not supported, so Linux systems will operate
	in polling mode.

	Apart from simplifying the use of select.kqueue calls, the intent is to
	mask changes that might be needed if linux inotify needs to be supported.
	Because of this, the interface avoids providing features that would be
	hard to implement in one or other interface.

	All open file descriptors are automatically closed when the instance
	is removed.

	The following params can be set when the class is initialized and
	overridden in methods where appropriate.

	  timeout       -  Aggregation timeout.  Because file change events
			   tend to arrive in bursts, setting an aggregation
			   timeout limits the number of calls and cuts
			   duplication of changes on a single file.  The
			   effect is that the method will keep retrieving
			   events until none arrive within the timeout period.
			   That means the get() method will block for at least
			   the timeout period, so the timeout should be small
			   (perhaps 0.1 seconds).  The default is 0 which
			   means the get() method will return immediately.

			   Note that even with a zero timeout, get() may still
			   return multiple events if multiple changes are
			   pending when it is called.

	  limit         -  Limit the number of change events that will
			   collected due to the aggregation timeout.  The
			   default is None (no limit).  The value is ignored
			   if a timeout is not set.  Note that the limit may
			   be exceeded if the last event read returns more
			   than one event.

	  commit        -  If False, skip rebuilding watch list after each
			   add() or remove().  The caller should then call
			   commit() directly to commit changes.

	  missing       -  If True, a file does not need to pre-exist
			   when add() is called.  In addition, a file added
			   with this flag set can disappear and reappear which
			   will cause an event each time.  With the flag False
			   which is the default, add() and get() will raise
			   exceptions if the file is initially missing or is
			   removed or renamed, and the file will cease being
			   watched until add() is called again.

	  polling	-  Force the interface into polling mode.  Only available
			   when instantiating the class.  Polling mode has no
			   practical advantage over file system events so this
			   param really exists for testing polling mode.

	  log		-  A logging instance.

		This method should be called periodically if files were added
		with "missing=False".  It will check for the appearance of missing
		files and ensure an event will be triggered for any that appear.

		It also needs to be called if the instance could be in WF_POLLING
		mode as file system changes will only be detected in WF_POLLING
		mode when scan() is called.

		The method should be called frequently (perhaps every 1-5 seconds)
		as part of idle processing in a select/poll loop.

		The approach is intended to support file appearance and disappearance
		using kqueue/kevent on BSD while retaining the ability in the
		future to transparently support inotify on Linux without any code
		or efficiency impact on callers.

		For WF_KQUEUE and WF_INOTIFYX mode, processing consists of determining
		that a pending path is now accessible, and then calling commit() to
		make the necessary adjustments.  This will be efficient as long as the
		list of pending paths is small.

		At some point this should be optimized by watching the directory of
		a pending target (assuming it exists).	If the directory changes to
		indicate the pending path might have appeared, then the next get()
		call should perform a scan().

		For WF_POLLING mode, the entire list of open files is also scanned
		looking for significant differences in the os.fstat info.

		If/when inotify is supported here, it is expected that the scan()
		method would be a no-op.
